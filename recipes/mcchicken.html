        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This copycat McChicken sandwich is made with well seasoned chicken breast and chicken thighs.</p>
        <p>Freezing the patties before frying helps them keep their shape.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>3/4 pound boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika, divided</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>6 hamburger buns, toasted</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups club soda</li>
            <li>oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>shredded iceberg lettuce, to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine chicken, garlic powder, white pepper, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped and it forms a uniform mixture.  </li>
            <li>Shape chicken mixture into 6 patties and freeze on a parchment or wax paper-lined baking sheet for 20 to 30 minute</li>
            <li>Heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk together flour, cornstarch, remaining salt, remaining paprika, and pepper in a bowl. Lightly coat partially frozen patties in flour mixture and shake off any excess mixture and set patties aside.  </li>
            <li>Add club soda to remaining flour mixture in bowl and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Working 2 to 3 at a time, dip patties into batter, allow excess to drip off and carefully place into the hot oil. Fry, while maintaining a temperature of 330 to 350 degrees F (165 to 175 degrees C), until golden brown, crispy, and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes per batch. Drain on a wire rack set inside a paper towel lined rimmed baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining patties. </li>
            <li>Serve patties on buns with shredded lettuce and mayonnaise. </li>
